[Project Pythia](https://projectpythia.org/) expanded its 
Scientific Python Ecosystem educational content during a 
successful hackathon with the introduction of
[Cookbooks](https://cookbooks.projectpythia.org/). 

Members of the Project Pythia team gathered in Boudler, CO 
and remotely for a hybrid hacakthon in late June 2022 to 
develop content and infrastructure for a new pillar of our 
learning resources called "Cookbooks." Pythia Cookbooks provide 
example workflows on more advanced problems encountered by geoscientists. 
Cookbooks build on top of skills you learn in the 
[Pythia Foundations book](https://foundations.projectpythia.org/).

During the hackthon, a detailed Cookbook template and 
[contributor's guide](https://github.com/ProjectPythiaCookbooks/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) 
were developed to encourage open-source community engagement. This 
allowed for the creation and inclusion of 8 Cookbooks which now 
viewable and filterable in a gallery.

Our perseverance, support, communication, and momentum all benefited 
from dedicating several days to the project together.
