The most destructive wildfire in Colorado history was ignited on
December 30, 2021 and spread quickly to neighborhoods in Superior
and Louisville, driven by drought parched vegetation and winds
gusting over 100 miles per hour. Over a thousand homes were lost
and thousands of people were evacuated. Numerical models of wildfires
developed by NCAR are some of the most sophisticated in the world,
and are used by researchers and forecasters to help analyze,
interpret, and predict the impact of wildfires on weather, air
quality, and the economy. A recent simulation with NCAR’s Coupled
Atmosphere-Wildland Fire Environment (CAWFE) model attempts to
recreate the devastating events of the day and was visualized by
the [ViSR]() team [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hVgvjs20vrc&t=57s).
