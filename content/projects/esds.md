NCAR's Earth System Data Science (ESDS) initiative aims to build a community of technical support 
for geoscientists by addressing common big data challenges. 
ESDS has four main goals: to facilitate the development of diagnostic frameworks, to improve coordination on analysis workflows, 
to explore science at scale, and to develop and curate educational materials.
